Only difference between USB EFI and SSD EFI is SMBIOS, USB EFI SMBIOS is set to MacBookPro13,1 where as SSD EFI is set to MacBookPro8,3.

Otherwise installation leads to an error where we cant select SSD Drive to install the OS, error is "this update cannot be installed on this computer", even after enabling boot arg -no_compat_check.
